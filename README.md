# romident
ROM identification (DAT file processor)

Reads clrmamepro (non-xml) dat files and then scans every file in the current directory to find matches.
Supply the name of the dat file as the first param.

Uses regex to read the dat file, supports SHA1, MD5 and CRC32 checksum. Limited support for zip files.

Needs a lot of work.
